General OpenACC usage, acts on the next scope (e.g. for loop)
OpenACC directive, tells compiler to break up next scope (e.g. for loop)
into separate GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)
#pragma acc kernels[clauses..]

Data Directive / Data Regions (usage detailed in examples)
#pragma acc data [clauses..]
  Possible Clauses:
    #pragma acc data copy(list){  }
      Copies 'list' from host (CPU) to device (GPU) so that
      'list' is not copied back and forth numerous times
      *Be Careful!* Things done by CPU to 'list' inside this scope
      will be overwritten when 'list' is copied back.

Parallel Regions


  Device Tuning
    #pragma acc parallel loop \
         device_type(nvidia) num_gangs(200) ...\
         device_type(radeon) num_gangs(400) ...
