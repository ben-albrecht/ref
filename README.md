# ref
## A Personal Reference Archive
My repository of assorted code snippets and notes on topics that come up a lot.
I'll usually add something to this repository when I find myself googling it 2 or 3 times.
I've also made a handy bash script over in my [scripts repo](https://github.com/exit-1/scripts/blob/master/ref) to access the reference files quickly.
